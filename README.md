# Qumomf

Qumomf is a Tarantool vshard high availability tool which supports discovery and recovery.

## How to add a new cluster

Edit your configuration file and add a new cluster, e.g.:

```yaml
clusters:
  my_cluster:
    routers:
      - name: 'my_cluster_router_1'
        addr: 'localhost:3301'
        uuid: 'my_cluster_router_1'
```

You might override default connection settings for each cluster.

```yaml
clusters:
  my_cluster:
    connection:
      user: 'tnt'
      password: 'tnt'
      connect_timeout: 10s
      request_timeout: 10s

    routers:
      - name: 'my_cluster_router_1'
        addr: 'localhost:3301'
        uuid: 'my_cluster_router_1'
```

For a sample vshard configuration, 
see [qumomf example](/example) or [Tarantool documentation](https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/1.10/reference/reference_rock/vshard/vshard_quick/#vshard-config-cluster-example).

Start qumomf, and it will discover all clusters defined in the configuration.

## Topology recovery

Just now qumomf supports only automated master recovery.
It is a configurable option and can be disabled completely or for a cluster via configuration.

Master election supports two modes:

1. `delay` - naive and simple elector which finds alive replica last communicated to the failed master (received data or heartbeat signal).
2. `smart` - elector tries to involve as many metrics as can:
  - vshard configuration consistency (prefer replica which has the same configuration as master), 
  - which upstream status did replica have before the crash,
  - how replica is far from master comparing LSN to master LSN,
  - last time when replica received data or heartbeat signal from master. 

Election mode might be configured for each cluster.

## Hacking

Feel free to open issues and pull requests with your ideas how to improve qumomf.

To run unit and integration tests:

```bash
make env_up
